## Motivation

I recently built a site for a client that uses Typescript and React Testing Library. And, for this site, I had to create a component that dynamically generates either a `<input type="text" />` or a `<textarea />` element based on the components `type` property. Developing this component from the perspective of meaningful tests was incredibly challenging and rewarding, so I thought I would share what I built along with the tests and create a companion blog post to provide insight into my thoughts behind the component's tests and design.
