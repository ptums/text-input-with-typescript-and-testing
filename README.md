# Typescript with React Testing Library and Jest Demo

This site is a simple demonstration on how to use ```map()``` and ```forEach()``` methods in javascript.

## Motivation

When I first used [React.js](https://reactjs.org), I discovered the javascript method ```map()``` to iterate over data in JSX. Having some previous experience writing functional code in JavaScript I already knew about ```forEach()```.  At first glance, I thought they served the same purpose, but when I tried using ```forEach()``` in JSX it spit out a bunch of errors.

This set me on a journey to take a deep dive into understanding the nature of these methods. This repository is a collection of my experiments and notes, which I've turned into a [github page](https://ptums.github.io/using-javascript-array-methods/). I also published an article of my discoveries on **Medium.com** [The power of the map method](https://medium.com/@petertumulty/the-power-of-the-map-method-4db6b1a73655).

Now, I am looking for recent bootcamp grads, bootcamp students, or any coders who are looking to up their coding skills and learn more about javascript make a fun educational website based on this content.
